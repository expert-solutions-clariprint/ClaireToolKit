 The Pdf module is used to write and read PDF (Portable Document Format)
 documents. On the one hand the PDF writer comes with a set of low level API to
 create pages, text boxes (using AFM font descriptions), graphic objects, PNG
 images, annotations, attachments, outlines and digital signatures. On top of
 this low level tools, the PDF writer has a (user extensible) HTML renderer
 with automated page layouting. On the second hand the PDF reader allow us
 to inspect the object structure of a PDF document and verify digital signature.
